Use case
In the event of a pandemic, measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the contagion. healthcare facilitys are required to screen patients and separate those in need of contagion testing from others. This process must be conducted in an orderly manner, informing patients of the expected wait time and notifying them when they can be admitted.
